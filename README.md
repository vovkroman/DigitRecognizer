# DigitRecognizer

### Description

This is companion app that efficiently solves **the handwritten digit recognition problem** (see demo), using Convolutional Neural Network ([CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)), structure proposed by [Yann LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun), aka [LeNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeNet).

### Requirements (Programming language)

Swift 4.2 and more & Objective-C 2.0

### Structure of project

The project contains 4 separated modules/frameworks (descriptions of each of them are listed below):

- [x] **FutureKit** - framework which provides an API for performing nonblocking asynchronous requests and combinator interfaces for serializing the processing of requests, error recovery and filtering. In most iOS libraries asynchronous interfaces are supported through the delegate-protocol pattern or with a callback. Even simple implementations of these interfaces can lead to business logic distributed over many files or deeply nested callbacks that can be hard to follow. **FutureKit** provides a very simple API to get rid of callback hell (inspired by [www.swiftbysundell.com](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/under-the-hood-of-futures-and-promises-in-swift/)).

- [x] **Canvas** - framework provides [UIKit UIView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview), that supports drawing action in the most performant way. There are 2 approaches to solve current problem: 
1. [**Core Graphics**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics) which performs drawing on CPU (using UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext); 
2. [**Core Animation**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore), works with [CALayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer), which performs drawing specificaly on GPU.

In the current implementation, the second approach was applied. Mechanism of drawing on Canvas is pretty staright forward:
1. In **touchesMoved**, we store the touch points inside of an array;
2. We call **setNeedsDisplay(rect:)** to mark the dirty area for redraw;
3. In **draw(layer:ctx:)**, we loop over the array of points and perform the actual drawing;
4. When the array reaches 200 points, we flatten the image into single layer and empty the array;

Follow the [link](https://github.com/vovkroman/DigitRecognizer/tree/develop/Canvas/Canvas) to get acquainted.
- [x] **MNIST** - framework implementing the logic of digit recognition, by given image. 
It has been implemented using Apple's [**BNNS**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/bnns). **BNNS** library is a collection of functions that you use to construct neural networks for training and inference. Itâ€™s supported in macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. **BNNS** provides routines optimized for high performance and low-energy consumption across all CPUs supported on those platforms. 

To gain the final result, a pretty confident model **Tensorflow** was used. Here pre-trained model was used [mnist-predict-from-model.ipynb](https://github.com/vovkroman/DigitRecognizer/blob/develop/MNIST/mnist-predict-from-model.ipynb), but the full TensorFlow script from the tutorial to generate the model [mnist-nn.ipynb](https://github.com/vovkroman/DigitRecognizer/blob/develop/MNIST/mnist-nn.ipynb) has been provided as well.

Let's focus on the architecture of Neural Network (basicaly, here used [LeNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeNet) with some modifications):

- Input data is image 28X28 (follow the [link](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to get acquainted with **MNIST dataset**, used to train NN);
- Apply convolution 5X5 32 channel kernel, to produce 28x28 32 channel feature maps;
- Apply max pooling 2X2 kernel, to produce 14x14 32 channel feature maps;
- Apply convolution 5x5 64 kernel channel, to produce 14x14 64 channel kernel feature maps;
- Apply max pooling 2X2 kernel, to produce 7x7 64 channel feature maps;
- Apply reshape to flatten to vector of 3136 values;
- Apply multiplies a matrix (fully connected layer) to produce vector of 1024 values;
- Apply multiplies a matrix (fully connected layer) to produce vector of 10 values;
- Apply softmax to get probabilities of every value;

And then, once NN is trained, we convert weights and biases into **.dataset** format and apply them onto Neural Network written in **BNNS**. But here we should be aware of **BNNS** is using a specific memory layout for the weights (thanks to [machinethink.net](https://machinethink.net/blog/apple-deep-learning-bnns-versus-metal-cnn/)):

```
weights[ outputChannel ][ inputChannel ][ kernelY ][ kernelX ]
```

- [x] **Digit Recognizer** - iOS target which aggregates all frameworks listed above.
